This is a project I am working on in Aerospace Dept, IISc Bangalore during May 2011.

It involves creating a GUI (including fetching data from a databse using JDBS) in Java using the Eclipse IDE for a flapping wing MAV (Micro Air-Vehicle) design and testing software.

This project is the initial phase of a national initiative by the Govt. of India. For more details, visit http://www.ndrfindia.org/goals.htm

Directions for running source code

Make sure the project folder (here it is mavdts) is copied to the eclipse workspace folder. The workspace folder for me was home/eclipse-workspace. I use Ubuntu. It should be pretty same for Mac adn Windows as well. So, after doing this, there will be a folder with the path home/eclipse-workspace/mavdts.

Then, open the eclipse IDE. If you are using Linux, you can do it from terminal by going to the eclipse folder in your system (For me, it was home/eclipse) and typing ./eclipse -vm ./jdk1.6.0_23/bin/java where ./jdk1.6.0_23/bin/java specified the path where Java could be found. Then, once the Eclipse IDE opens, go to File>Import. In that, General>Existing Projects into Workspace. Then you browse for your project directory which is mavdts in the workspace folder. It's now successfully imported. 

To connect to database, make sure you have mySQL installed in your computer. Add the external JAR (mysql-connector-java-5.1.16-bin.jar) to the project. This can be done by going to Project>Properties>Java Buil Path>Libraries>Add external JARs. Browse for the above mentioned JAR which should be copied to where java is located in your computer.

Then go to Run>Run As>Java Application.
